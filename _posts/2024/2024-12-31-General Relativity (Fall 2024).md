The General Relativity course for this semester was taught by Professor [Li Li](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~liliphysics) (Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Professor [Tang Yong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yongtang) (School of Astronomy and Space Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences). The primary textbook used was Lecture Notes on General Relativity by Professor Huang Chaoguang.

It is the course I spent the most time and effort on this semester, and it is also the one that left me with the deepest impressions. Before the course officially began, my foundation was limited to the first six chapters of *Introduction to Differential Geometry and General Relativity* (Volume I) by Liang Canbin and Zhou Bin. At that time, I often glossed over the material without delving deeply into the concepts. Gradually, I realized this approach was problematic, as the abstract index notation was rarely practical. So, I turned to books that used explicit indices.  

I started with *General Relativity* by Liu Liao and Zhao Zheng, skimming through the tensor analysis section and jotting down a few notes in $\LaTeX$. Liu Liao, a renowned expert in the field of general relativity in China, wrote a masterpiece that is not easy to digest at first. I still had many unresolved questions regarding tensor analysis after reading it. Upon a classmate’s recommendation, I turned to *Foundations of General Relativity* by Zhao Zheng and Liu Wenbiao.  

Professor Zhao’s book has a lower starting point and comprehensive content. I spent a week going through the essential parts of the book (Chapters 1-4, 6) and took [extensive notes](https://collapsar0615.github.io/posts/2104.12785/). After reading it, I gained a clear understanding of the overall framework of classical general relativity and resolved many of the questions I had while studying Liu Liao's book, successfully completing the "zero to one" leap in understanding general relativity.  

To move "from one to N",I also delved into other works, which were equally rewarding:  
- *Gravitation and Cosmology* by Steven Weinberg  
- *Lectures on General Relativity* by Huang Chaoguang  
- *General Relativity* by Chen Bin  
- *A First Course in General Relativity* by Bernard F. Schutz  
- *Introduction to Differential Geometry and General Relativity* (Volumes II and III) by Liang Canbin and Zhou Bin  

As a whole, the General Relativity course was difficult in terms of lectures but relatively easy in terms of exams. The syllabus covered most of the content from all three volumes of Liang’s book, while the exams primarily consisted of conceptual short-answer questions (e.g., "What are the energy conditions?", "How do you understand the equivalence principle?", "What is the Chandrasekhar limit?", "What is the proportion of dark energy?"). Even the most basic topics, such as tensor transformations and Christoffel symbol calculations, were not tested, which felt like a missed opportunity.Nevertheless, I truly gained a lot from this course, and my final grade was a perfect score (although not very very high). For me, a total freshman in GR, maybe that is something to be content with.
